# Reading from Databases

Spark is also compatible with many databases for import and more may
be added soon - we won't go over them all here - refer to the
[Apache Spark Examples Directory](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/examples)
which contains more examples that may be useful to you.  Most likely, you
aren't going to be reading your logs data in from a databases, but there
may be other data you want to input to Spark.
